# These icons are not part of the eggy project/program, they are only provided so you won't have crappy icons.
# Hence the eggy should not receive credit for the icons located in this folder.
# The icon set is, if memory serves me right, taken from http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php/Dark-Glass+reviewed?content=67902
# Eggy took the comment and uncomment icons from the Eric IDE
# Here follows the original readme

This icon set is a derivate of OS-K set and many replaced icons, directly produced from mentalrey (me). the target is to have many icons like "dark glass" and whith some photorealistic effect (not too much photorealistic). Normally I prefer to use icons in 96 pixel or 128, I hope you like it.

99% of this set is GPL now and what's not is most likely creative commons (a tiny number of the mime types may be proprietary). PLEASE abide by the licence rules, if you use icons from this set please research and credit the appropriate people. I have been given permission to release other peoples art work under the GPL so respect the licence.

Enjoy ")

----------------Installation-------------

Just download the archive, uncompress and copy to /usr/share/icons then choose Dark-Glass icons from the KDE control center.

If you want to customise your kmenu icon: Once uncompressed, enter 'apps' and 'actions' and remove the '_YOURDISTRO' from the icon of your choice (there are a few).

Have fun.
