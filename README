<<<<<<<<<<<<<< HOW TO INSTALL EGGY >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Eggy is currently only available for *nix. Eggy has the following dependencies:
      - Python (2.4 or higher)
      - Qt4 (4.3.*)
      - PyQt4 (4.3.*)
      - QScintilla v2


<<<<<< GNU/Linux >>>>>>
If you run GNU/Linux, these dependencies are probably available in your distro's
package manager.

      On Ubuntu (8.04) or Debian Lenny/Sid:
             sudo apt-get install python-qscintilla2 python-qt4</>

      On Gentoo:
             sudo emerge -uvaD qscintilla-python PyQt4


If you run a distro not listed, consult your package manager or build from source.


<<<<<< Mac OSX >>>>>>
If you run Mac OSX you will need to manually fetch and install these packages. 

    1) Start with checking for python. Open your terminal emulator and type 
    
            type python

    2) If it says "python is /usr/bin/python" (or "python is /my/path/to/python"), 
       you should check if you have the correct version by issuing python -V from 
       the command line (you need a version of 2.4 or higher). If you have a correct 
       version you can go to step 4. If you don't you will need to fetch and 
       reinstall python (step 3).

    3) You can install python by fetching python-2.5.2-macosx.dmg from python.org and 
       executing it. Now refresh your shell by typing "exec bash".

    4) Installing PyQt requires you to have Xcode, "Apple's premiere development 
       environment for Mac OS X", installed. According to the apple site this is 
       packaged on your Mac OS X DVD. If you managed to break or lose your DVD, 
       you can download it at http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode.

    5) It's now time to fetch and install qt-mac-opensource-4.3.4.dmg 
       (or a newer version if it's available) from the Trolltech site 
       (http://www.trolltech.com/). In the meantime, grab yourself a cup of coffee.

    6) Create a new directory (e.g. mkdir pyqt) and download and save 
       PyQt-mac-gpl-4.3.3.tar.gz and sip-4.7.4.tar.gz from 
       http://www.riverbankcomputing.com to your newly created folder and type 
            
            cd pyqt 
       
       Now untar the files with the command: 
       
            for i in *.tar.gz; do tar -xzvf "$i"; done.

    7) Finally type 
            command='python configure.py && make && sudo make install'; 
            cd sip-* && eval $command && cd ../PyQt-* && eval $command 

       You are now done and ready to run eggy.
